  NAI (Artificial Intelligence Tools)
</h1>

Repository that contains solutions to the exercises, as well as computational tasks generators, for the NAI (Artificial Intelligence Tools) extracurricular projects and implementations, taught by Marcin Sydow during studies on [PJAIT](https://www.pja.edu.pl/en/).

The following code is distributed under the [GPLv3](./LICENSE).

NOTE: Much of the code in this repository is of subpar quality, due to circumstances such as basic course scope, omittance of some topics during the course (ex. weights initialization) and time constraints. In the future some of the areas might be revisited for refactorization, but the overall functionality will remain as-is.
